# Sentiment analysis on text fetched from URL

This Project performs sentiment analysis on text retrieved from a provided URL. It utilizes Python libraries like requests to fetch the article content and nltk for sentiment analysis.

## Appendix

Components

1 )Data Fetching:

requests Library: This library facilitates making HTTP requests to retrieve web content.
URL Input: The user provides the URL of the article to be analyzed.
Error Handling: Implement mechanisms to handle potential errors like invalid URLs or network issues.
Text Preprocessing:

2 )Extract Text: Parse the fetched HTML content to extract the main article text (consider using libraries like Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing).
Cleaning: Remove irrelevant information like ads, navigation elements, and HTML tags.
Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words or sentences for further processing.
Normalization: Convert text to lowercase and remove punctuation for consistency.
Sentiment Analysis:

3 )nltk Library: The Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) provides tools for sentiment analysis.
Lexicon-Based Approach: Utilize sentiment lexicons like NLTK's Vader or custom-built lexicons with positive and negative word scores.
Machine Learning Approach: For more advanced analysis, train a sentiment classification model on labeled datasets (consider libraries like scikit-learn for machine learning).


4) Sentiment Scoring:Iterate Through Words: Loop through each word in the preprocessed text.
Lookup Scores: Check if the word exists in the sentiment lexicon and obtain its associated score.
Aggregate Scores: Calculate separate scores for positive and negative sentiment by summing the respective word scores.
Overall Sentiment: Based on the positive and negative scores, determine the overall sentiment of the article (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). You can also calculate a sentiment ratio (positive score / negative score).
